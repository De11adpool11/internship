TELL ME HOW CAN I WRITE WHATEVER SKILLS I HAVE COZ I CANT REMEMBER ALL OF THEM NOW
Got it, JOsa. You‚Äôre trying to capture all your skills, but your brain‚Äôs like, ‚Äúnah, I‚Äôm on break.‚Äù Totally normal. Let‚Äôs fix that with a system that jogs your memory and organizes your skills like a pro.

üß† Step-by-Step: How to Recall & Write Down Your Skills
1. Use a Skill Trigger List
Think of categories that spark memory. Go through these one by one:

Category	Examples to Jog Your Memory
Programming	Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL
Tools & Platforms	VS Code, GitHub, Canva, OBS
Soft Skills	Communication, problem-solving, time management
Creative Skills	Image editing, video scripting, thumbnail design
Teaching/Explaining	Tutoring, YouTube content, mentoring
Math & Logic	Aptitude, puzzles, reasoning
Miscellaneous	Freelancing, content writing, organizing events
Go through each and write down anything you‚Äôve ever done‚Äîeven once. If you‚Äôve used Canva to make a thumbnail, that‚Äôs a skill.

2. Use Your Past Work or Projects
Ask yourself:

What have I built, solved, or helped with?

What did I do for my YouTube channel?

What tools did I use while studying or freelancing?

Even small things count. For example:

‚ÄúEdited images for thumbnails using Canva‚Äù = image editing ‚ÄúSolved aptitude questions for college prep‚Äù = analytical thinking

3. Use a Simple Format to Write It Down
Here‚Äôs a clean way to list your skills:

markdown

Your channel is a living portfolio‚Äîmine it for skills.

5. Use a Free Tool to Organize It
